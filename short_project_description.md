# h8 identifier - no space for hate
Disturbing comments on minorities, political opponents and content creators can be found all over the internet. Some might be discomforting but others may be threatening. The riot of the Capitol was just one of many events which could possibly be avoided if hate campaigns via social media were detected and the spread blocked.

Our h8identifier raises awareness about the amount and content of hate speech before those messages can be spread to cause more harm. We trained the h8 identifier to differentiate between hate and non-hate speech. In our vision h8 identifier should give a warning if the threshold for too much hate is reached before such a message can be spread to cause more harm. 

Our focus are comments on youtube, one of the most frequented social media platforms nowadays. Our target group is the youtuber, who can disable these comments, and also people who want to enjoy a video without hateful comments. The user can access the h8 identifier through a web application and input a youtube video url. H8 identifier will display the hate analysis and give recommendations based on the percentage of hate comments.

Our project consists of following parts:

1. Supervised Machine Learning: Train a Binary Classifier with a prelabeled dataset.
2. Data import from Youtube, cleaning and analysis
3. Machine Learning pipeline which takes a youtube video url and generates a feasible prediction of the hate.
4. Develop a web application and visualize the personalized results of the hate in statistics relevant for the user.
5. UX Design: Implement an optimal design.
